# What is Choose Fun?
Choose Fun is a new course code students can use to replace any a traditional Trinity Requirement. That one Natural Science credit you're stugggling to get can be replaced with any class under the CF code. These classes are some of the most fun, unique and creative courses at Duke with the hope that students with step out of their comfort zone and have some fun.

# How it Works
Some courses will have a "CF" code in addition to traditional course codes. These are courses that have been determined to be unique, engaging, and interdisciplinary in nature.
